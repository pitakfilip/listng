# Dummy development projects

instead of opening the whole repository as a single project, use one of the following dummy project with 
the appropriate modules imported

- dev-all : contains all modules imported
- dev-BE : contains all microservices
- dev-FE : contains all modules needed for FE development (consul, REST, UI)
